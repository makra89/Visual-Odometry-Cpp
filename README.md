# Visual-Odometry-Cpp
Visual Odometry pipeline implementation in C++

I am a former physicist working as a software engineer in topics like sensor data fusion. I have a strong interest in computer vision and always wondered how things like feature tracking magically work in some open-source projects. 
After taking part in the coursera course Robotics:Perception, I decided to just try it out myself and learn :) 

# The task

It would be rather straightforward to use opencv and just connect the provided functionality to some kind of visual odometry pipeline. What I rather try to do:

- Creating a visual odometry pipeline from scratch (see below) extracting poses from monocular camera images
- Implementing all major algorithms (like feature detection, description,..) myself
- Using only utility functions and structs from opencv. For me also things like SVD count as such.
- Having fun, so please pardon the lack of testing and documentation. I do enough of this at work.
- ....... And finally hop on the open-source train ;) 

The goal is not to create yet another visual odometry pipeline that can easily be used by everyone. There exist multiple sophisticated open-source projects for this. But maybe this project helps someone understanding visual odometry. 

What I 

# Current functionality

The only functionality provided so far is very basic feature matching, description and matching:
- Harris edge detector
- BRIEF descriptor
- Brute force matcher

# Usage

Using the application TrackFeatures.exe in apps/ it is possible to visualize matched features in an camera image stream:
`TrackFeatures.exe <path-to-camera-images> e.g. TrackFeatures.exe ./test/*.jpg` 

# Dependencies

Dependencies are placed in the folder 3rdparty and included during build.
